    <h1>JPEG (or JPG)</h1>

    <h2>Joint Photographic Experts Group</h2>

    <p>JPEGs might be the most common file type you run across on the web, and more than likely the kind of image that is in your company's MS Word version of its letterhead. JPEGs are known for their "lossy" compression, meaning that the quality of the image decreases as the file size decreases. You can use JPEGs for projects on the web, in Microsoft Office documents, or for projects that require printing at a high resolution. Paying attention to the resolution and file size with JPEGs is essential in order to produce a nice looking project..</p>

    <!-- the assignment sheet lists a bunch of different tags for text elements and basic formatting. i want you to fill in this document with all of those elements. 
    
    some of the tags are for actual text elements and some are inline, meaning you apply them inside of text elements. the following text element has an inline italic applied -->

    <h1> PNG </h1>
    <h2>Portable Network Graphics</h2>
    <p> PNGs are amazing for interactive documents such as web pages, but are not suitable for print. While PNGs are "lossless," meaning you can edit them and not lose quality, they are still low resolution. The reason PNGs are used in most web projects is that you can save your image with more colors on a transparent background. This makes for a much sharper, web-quality image.</p>

    <h1>GIF</h1>
    <h2>Graphics Interchange Format</h2>
    <p>GIFs are most common in their animated form, which are all the rage on Tumblr pages and in banner ads. It seems like every other day we have a new Grumpy Cat or Honey Boo Boo animated GIF. In their more basic form, GIFs are formed from up to 256 colors in the RGB colorspace. Due to the limited number of colors, the file size is drastically reduced. This is a common file type for web projects where an image needs to load very quickly, as opposed to one that needs to retain a higher level of quality. </p>

    <h1>PSD</h1>
    <h2>Photoshop Document</h2>
    <p>PSDs are files that are created and saved in Adobe Photoshop, the most popular graphics editing software ever. This type of file contains "layers" that make modifying the image much easier to handle. This is also the program that generates the raster file types mentioned above. The largest disadvantage to PSDs is that Photoshop works with raster images as opposed to vector images. </p>

    <h1>PDF</h1>
    <h2>Portable Document Format</h2>
    <p> PDFs were invented by Adobe with the goal of capturing and reviewing rich information from any application, on any computer, with anyone, anywhere. I'd say they've been pretty successful so far. If a designer saves your vector logo in PDF format, you can view it without any design editing software (as long as you have downloaded the free Acrobat Reader software), and they have the ability to use this file to make further manipulations. This is by far the best universal tool for sharing graphics. </p>

    <title>HTML Responsive</title>
</head>

<body>
    <h1>Responsive Web Design is about using HTML and CSS to automatically resize, hide, shrink, or enlarge, a website, to make it look good on all devices (desktops, tablets, and phones)</h1>
    <h2>Setting The Viewpoint</h2>
      <p>When making responsive web pages, add the following <meta> element in all your web pages:  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> </p>
    <h2> Responsive Text Sizes</h2>
        <P>The text size can be set with a "vw" unit, which means the "viewport width". That way the text size will follow the size of the browser window: (h1 style="font-size:10vw">Hello World/h1)</P>
